## About Me

I am a **Senior Software Engineer** at [Astronomer](https://www.astronomer.io/), where I work on the design and engineering of [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) - an open source data orchestration platform. Astronomer is the orchestration platform for the modern data stack. Built on Kubernetes, Astronomer makes it easy to run, monitor, and scale Apache Airflow clusters in our cloud or yours. I'm passionate about building scalable data infrastructure and contributing to open source projects that impact the developer community.

As a strong advocate of open source and believer in "Learning by Doing," I have contributed to several high-impact projects including [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow), [Ask-Astro](https://github.com/astronomer/ask-astro), [Universal Transfer Operator](https://github.com/astronomer/apache-airflow-provider-transfers), [Astro-Python-SDK](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk), [Astronomer-Providers](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-providers), and [OpenCV CVAT](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat).
