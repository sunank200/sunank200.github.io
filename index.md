## About Me

I am a **Senior Software Engineer** at [Astronomer](https://www.astronomer.io/), where I work on the design and engineering of [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) - an open source data orchestration platform. Astronomer is the orchestration platform for the modern data stack. Built on Kubernetes, Astronomer makes it easy to run, monitor, and scale Apache Airflow clusters in our cloud or yours. I'm passionate about building scalable data infrastructure and contributing to open source projects that impact the developer community.

As a strong advocate of open source and believer in "Learning by Doing," I have contributed to several high-impact projects including [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow), [Ask-Astro](https://github.com/astronomer/ask-astro), [Universal Transfer Operator](https://github.com/astronomer/apache-airflow-provider-transfers), [Astro-Python-SDK](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk), [Astronomer-Providers](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-providers), and [OpenCV CVAT](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat).

## Notable Projects

### Current Company Projects
- **Ask-Astro**: LLM-powered chatbot for Apache Airflow community with RAG and Weaviate vector store, integrating Apache Airflow with advanced LLM technology to create a versatile chatbot and knowledge interface, leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation and Weaviate vector store for enhanced AI-driven query response capabilities in Airflow and Astronomer domains
- **Universal Transfer Operator**: Unified interface that simplifies how users transfer data from a source to a destination using Apache Airflow. It offers a consistent agnostic interface, improving the users' experience so they do not need to use explicitly specific providers or operators. This operator reduces the need for 100+ transfer operators to a single operator on Airflow
- **Astronomer-Providers**: Open-source provider ecosystem for Apache Airflow

### Previous Technical Projects
- **Pest Management System**: PyTorch-based model running on phone/cloud to identify harmful pests, alert farmers about infestation and reduce crop loss in cotton farming. Currently used by 11,000+ farmers
- **COVID-19 Mobility Dashboard**: Real-time dashboard integrating with COVID-19 Mobility Data Network and Facebook Data For Good, enabling 11 state government authorities in India with actionable insights to optimize emergency protocols
- **Annotation Studio**: Data (artifacts and annotation) management and job orchestration platform to manage, schedule and orchestrate annotation jobs across multiple annotation vendors using Apache Airflow, FastAPI and React
- **Real-time Route Planning**: Multi-modal transport optimization using modified NSGA-II algorithm

## Interests

I'm broadly interested in **Software Engineering**, **Data Engineering**, **Computer Vision**, and **Computer Systems**. I'm also a robotics enthusiast and was a Fellow at Teach for India. Always an aspiring polymath!
